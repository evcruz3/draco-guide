```

### Interactive Learning (Recommended)
```bash
jupyter notebook draco_intern_guide.ipynb
```

### Python Script Usage
```bash
python draco_intern_guide.py
```

### Run Tests
```bash
python test_intern_guide.py
```

## 🧬 Key Features

### ✅ Validated Methods
- **`schema_from_dataframe()`** - Automatic data analysis and profiling
- **`schema_from_file()`** - File-based analysis with Path objects
- **`dict_to_facts()`** - Dictionary to ASP facts conversion
- **`is_satisfiable()` & `run_clingo()`** - Constraint solving engine
- **`complete_spec()`** - Automated visualization generation

### 🔬 Genomic Applications
- **Biomarker Discovery** - Identify tissue-specific expression patterns
- **Variant Analysis** - Quality filtering and significance testing
- **Clinical Correlation** - Link genomic data to patient outcomes
- **Automated Pipelines** - Production-ready analysis workflows

### 🛠️ Production-Ready Features
- Comprehensive error handling
- Safe wrapper functions
- Fallback methods for reliability
- Detailed logging and validation

## 📊 Sample Data

The guide includes realistic genomic datasets:
- **Gene Expression Data** - Multi-tissue expression profiles
- **Variant Data** - Genetic variants with quality scores
- **Clinical Data** - Patient information and diagnoses

## 🎓 Learning Path

1. **Start with Setup** - Install dependencies and verify installation
2. **Explore Schema Analysis** - Learn automatic data profiling
3. **Master Constraint Solving** - Use ASP for biological reasoning
4. **Build Visualization Specs** - Generate automated charts
5. **Create Complete Pipelines** - Integrate all methods
6. **Apply to Your Research** - Adapt for your genomic datasets

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- Always use error handling with Draco methods
- Use Path objects for file operations
- Test satisfiability before generating models
- Implement fallback methods for reliability
- Use dictionaries (not lists) for dict_to_facts()

### ❌ Don'ts
- Don't generate too many models at once
- Don't assume all methods work in all contexts
- Don't skip error handling in production code
- Don't use raw strings for file paths

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Custom Genomic Analysis Pipeline
```python
from draco_intern_guide import genomic_analysis_pipeline

# Run complete analysis
results = genomic_analysis_pipeline()
```

### Safe Constraint Solving
```python
from draco_intern_guide import safe_constraint_solving

program = [
    'gene("BRCA1").',
    'high_expression(Gene) :- gene(Gene), expression_level(Gene, Level), Level > 40.'
]

results = safe_constraint_solving(program)
```

## 📈 Performance Notes

- **Schema analysis**: Very fast and reliable
- **Constraint solving**: Use small model counts (models=1-5)
- **Visualization completion**: Works well with proper Vega-Lite specs
- **Memory usage**: Efficient with moderate-sized datasets
